1. Software Components:

Reaction-Diffusion Model:

Purpose: Simulates the reaction-diffusion process on a 2D grid based on the Turing model equations.
Input: Reaction parameters (e.g., rate constants), diffusion coefficients, and initial concentration profiles.
Output: Concentration matrices for each species across the grid at each time step.
Pattern Visualization (PV):

Purpose: Converts the concentration data from the RDM component into visual patterns using matplotlib or similar libraries.
Input: Concentration matrices from the RDM component.
Output: Plots of the simulated Turing patterns, saved as images or displayed in the Jupyter Notebook.
Parameter Sweep Manager (PSM):

Purpose: Manages a sweep over different parameters to generate various patterns, helping users explore the impact of different parameter values.
Input: Ranges of parameters (e.g., reaction rates, diffusion constants) and step sizes.
Output: Multiple pattern images with corresponding parameter values.
2. Interactions to Accomplish Use Cases:

For Pattern Generation: The user provides parameters to the RDM component, which simulates the system and produces a matrix of concentration values. The PV component then takes this data to display or save the resulting pattern.
For Parameter Sweep for Pattern Exploration: The user provides parameter ranges to the PSM component, which iterates through these values, calling the RDM component for each set of parameters. The PV component is used to visualize each resulting pattern, allowing users to observe the effect of parameter changes.
3. Preliminary Plan:

1. Create core RDM with functions for initial concentration setup, reaction terms, and diffusion terms.
2. Add PV functionality for visualizing the results.
3. Implement PSM to support iterative parameter testing.
4. Integrate and test interactions between components.
